This project applies unsupervised machine learning to segment Amazon Prime users based on their subscription and engagement patterns. It uses KMeans clustering and evaluates the segmentation quality using the Silhouette Score.

Objectives; Preprocess a real-world dataset of Amazon Prime users -- Encode categorical features using LabelEncoder -- Identify user segments with KMeans clustering -- Evaluate cluster quality with Silhouette Score -- Prepare dataset for potential business analysis and personalization

Tools & Libraries; Python 3 -- pandas, numpy – for data manipulation -- sklearn – for clustering, encoding, and evaluation -- matplotlib, seaborn – for data visualization -- Jupyter Notebook

Files; KMeans Clustering & Silhouette_score - Amazon Prime Users.ipynb – Main notebook -- amazon_prime_users.csv – Input dataset

How to Run; Clone the repository -- Install the required  -- Run the notebook -- Explore the preprocessing, clustering, and analysis

Results; Number of clusters: 3 -- Silhouette Score: 0.3035 -- Cluster labels assigned based on:*Subscription Plan *Payment Information *Usage Frequency *Favorite Genres
